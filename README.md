What about public transport in rural areas?

This paper provides a tool for calculating accessibility in rural areas.
The user provides the centres of settlements and the points of interest (services) in .shp as well as the gtfs file of the bus routes for the area of interest.
The road network is automatically downloaded from the open road map after the user enters the coordinates of a polygonal area of interest.
